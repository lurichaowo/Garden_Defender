# Garden_Defender

##### This Garden Defender Game was the first project I had finished in my Game Programming class during my last year in High School. The concept of the project was to allow us to familiarize ourselves with the Unity3D interface, the concept of objects, and collision detection.0

##### To run this game open up "garden defender game.exe" and enjoy.
